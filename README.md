# Modular First Person

My attempt to make a simple, yet flexible, first person controller system for Unity.


## Early work-in-progress!

This is a pretty early work in progress. While I'm building this off of my experience putting together first person controllers for a few prototypes, it's likely that this is going to take a while before it's complete for a game. By all means use it and let me know how I can improve it, but don't expect it to be a drop-in solution for a first person controller just yet.

I will have a sample repo coming soon, but I don't have it setup just yet.
