# First Person Controller

My attempt to make a simple, yet flexible, first person controller system for Unity.


## Features

Currently I'm focused on player movement abilities. I've implemented the following so far:

- Walk
- Run
- Crouch
- Jump
- Lean 
- Slide

I'm hoping to eventually add climbing up/down ladders and mantling to the list.

Once movement is feeling solid I plan to move into more interaction based systems like opening doors, inspecting items, and some form of holding things in first person (be it a flashlight, a gun, etc).

Basically I want this to be a pretty solid starting point for almost any first person game.


## Early work-in-progress!

This is a pretty early work in progress. While I'm building this off of my experience putting together first person controllers for a few prototypes, it's likely that this is going to take a while before it's complete for a game. By all means use it and let me know how I can improve it, but don't expect it to be a drop-in solution for a first person controller just yet.
